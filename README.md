"Each individual FCN φψ takes as input the heightmap image representation of the state st and outputs a dense pixel-wise map of Q values with the same image size and resolution as that of st, where each individual Q value prediction at a pixel p represents the future expected reward of executing primitive ψ at 3D location q where q 􏰏 p ∈ st. Note that this formulation is a direct amalgamation of Q-learning with visual affordance-based manipulation." (Arvix)[]
